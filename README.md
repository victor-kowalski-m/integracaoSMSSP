The code presented in [integracao.ipynb](integracao.ipynb) consists in a series of processing steps of around 500 *csv* files regarding medical appointments in the municipality of São Paulo, in Brazil (which sums up to around 150 million rows and 80 GB of data). The goal was to convert this data to a relational database structure. PostgreSQL was used for storing the converted data. The whole process is summarized in the flowchart bellow.
